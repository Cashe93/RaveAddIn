If you have previously created a [RAVE project]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Concepts/project/), you can reload it at any time to add to it or browse through it using the `Open Project` command. The command brings up the `Open Project` dialog, which is a standard browse dialog to locate the `*.rs.xml` [project file]({{ site.baseurl }}/Help/Concepts/project/) you wish to load.

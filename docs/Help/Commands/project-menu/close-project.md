The `Close Project` dialog allows you to close the current project loaded in RAVE. This is helpful if you want to clear the [Project Explorer]({{ site.baseurl }}/gcd-command-reference/project-explorer). Note that closing the current ArcMap map document will also automatically close the current project. However, closing the RAVE Project does not close the open ArcMap map document.
